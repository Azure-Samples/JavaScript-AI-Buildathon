# What is the JavaScript AI Build-a-thon?

The JavaScript AI Build-a-thon is a focused, hands-on initiative that helps **builders** quickly move from exploration to working AI prototypes. Through concise quests and practical demos, you'll gain real skills with modern AI tools in a clear, outcome-driven format.

**This isn't just another hackathon. It's your launchpad into the Agentic future of JavaScript and TypeScript development.**

If you're building your first AI app or architecting multi-agent systems, the Build-a-thon gives you the tools, the mentorship, and the stage to ship something real.

# Key Dates
